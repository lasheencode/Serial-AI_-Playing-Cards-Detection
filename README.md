# Serial-AI_-Playing-Cards-Detection

__**Playing Cards Detection**__

**Description:**
For this project we will classifying and creating bounding boxes around images of playing cards

**Overview:**
 - 5000 training sets
 - 1000 test sets
 - Bounding box data is given
 - High quality images
 - Images of cards have been placed on many different background for optimal training
 
**Dataset:**
